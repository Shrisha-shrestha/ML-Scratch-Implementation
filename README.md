# ML-Scratch-Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of neural networks from scratch, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

## Setup

### Creating and Activating Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Code

## Install Jupyter if not already installed

pip install jupyter
