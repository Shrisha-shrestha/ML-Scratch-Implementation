# ML-Scratch-Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of neural networks from scratch, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

## Setup

### Creating and Activating Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Implementations

### Artificial Neural Network

Basic feedforward neural network with fully connected layers, supporting backpropagation and gradient descent optimization.

### Convolutional Neural Network

CNN implementation with convolutional layers, pooling operations, and flattening for image classification tasks.

### Recurrent Neural Network

RNN implementation with LSTM cells for sequential data processing and time-series predictions.
